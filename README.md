## Langauge DB
It is written in:

* yii Framework

## Documentation

Documentation is located in the Docs directory

## My Code

While much of this is MVC framework and add-ons, the following files are particularly all my doing:
/protected/components/ApiController.php
/protected/controllers/NotesApiController.php
/protected/controllers/ApitestController.php

## Sample Site

The sample site is feature rich.  In addition to allowing users to add / edit their accounts, users can test the API.

To test the API:
* Create an account
* Log In
* Clicking on the 'testing' link
* Test out CRUD + List!
