Installation notes:
-------------------

Database: 
---------

For this demo we use MySQL. By default the user tries to connect to "localhost" with the following information:

host		: localhost
database	: cpbbackendlab
user		: cpbbackendlab
password	: cpbbackendlab

If you need to change this, you have to change in 2 places:

 - backend/src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml
 - backend/src/main/resources/application.properties

You need maven 3 to build the code.

Go to backend folder and type  

	mvn package
	
Find the war in the target folder.

Deploy:
-------

You need tomcat 6 or newer. Also you need to copy the file spring-tomcat-weaver-2.5.6.SEC03.jar in your tomcats lib folder.


Arquitecture:
-------------

The applications uses Sptring 3, Spring MVC (for webservices), Eclipse Link (for persistence) and Jascson Mapper (for JSON serialization)
