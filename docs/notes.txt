NotesApi implementation is using express+mongodb+passport stack.

To use it:

Browse / - to login via google authentication. This would set the proper cookie header so it will be possible to use the following API:

POST	/notes?text=xxx			- create a new note, returns { ID, Text }
GET	/notes				- lists all notes [{ ID, Text }, ...]
GET	/notes/:id			- gets the note by id, returns { ID, Text }
PUT	/notes/:id?text=xxx		- updates the note by id, returns { ID, Text }
DELETE	/notes/:id			- deletes the note by id

It's possible to add more auhtentication options, and implement login as separate API call but this would require additional time, and it's better to negotiate them before implementation.
