## Documentation

This system performs full CRUD + Listing of Notes for a user.

Authentication is managed with a combination of Username and API Key.  The user specifies both of these when they create their account via the Web interface.

## Server Setup

Other than placing the code on your server in a yii-enable directory, the only other step is to create the database and tables.  The database and test data located in the file schema.mysql.sql.

## Notes

Given more time, I would added unit tests.
